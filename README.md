Bank Marketing Machine Learning Pipeline

A full ML workflow including preprocessing, EDA, multiple model training, experiments, tuning, and evaluation.

📌 Project Overview

This project analyses the Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Repository) to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit after being contacted by a marketing campaign.

Using Python and modern machine learning methods, this project:

Loads and preprocesses the dataset

Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Trains 3 machine learning models

Performs 3 parameter-tuning experiments

Generates evaluation metrics and visualisations

Compares all models

This repository supports my university progress evaluation report.

🚀 Models Implemented

This pipeline trains and evaluates the following models:

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

LightGBM Classifier

Each model is trained using both default parameters and experimentally tuned parameters.
